- Block: A functionally independent page component that can be reused. In HTML, blocks are represented by the class attribute.

- Element: A composite part of a block that can`t be used separately from it.

- Modifier: An entity that defines the appearance, state, or behavior of a block or element.

# Contributing / Testing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

Testing tools include:

- Jest
- Enzyme
- Cypress

When targeting UI please use custom attributes e.g `data-test="my-target"`

Do not target using classes, id, selectors etc... for obvious reasons

Attributes are automatically ignored if their value is `undefined`, which we can use to our advantage!
